# tket_benchmarking
Scripts and circuits for benchmarking quantum compilation platforms.

This repository provides an access point for scripts and data from benchmarks of the tket compiler and other associated quantum compilation tools.

The "active" folder is aimed to keep an up-to-date benchmark where possible and we are happy to accept feedback or contributions for updates, additional benchmark sets, and support for additional systems to provide a more comprehensive view.

Other folders are for historic scripts used for results published in papers from the pytket developers.
